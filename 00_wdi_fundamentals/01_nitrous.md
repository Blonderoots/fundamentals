**WDI Fundamentals**

# Setting Up Your Nitrous Box

In order for you to complete this course, you will need to write and run Ruby
programs. Instead of having you install Ruby on your computer to do this, we
will look to the cloud for a different solution. That solution is called Nitrous.
Nitrous is a service that allows you to set up virtual machines with
customized environments, and gives you access to create and edit files, and run
programs on this virtual machine. Each virtual machine on Nitrous is called a
"box". It is possible to create a box with Ruby already installed on it, getting
a lot of tedious installation out of the way, and allowing us to focus on code.

Follow these steps to set up a Nitrous box for your work during this course.

* Create an account on the [Nitrous website](http://nitrous.io)
* Visit your dashboard (Click "Open Dashboard")
* Click "New Box"
* On the next configuration screen
  * Select the "Ruby/Rails" template
  * Give your box a name
  * Select a region closest to you
  * Leave the "Download a GitHub repo" field blank
  * Click "Create Box"

You should now be taken to your "box"'s IDE, or Integrated Development
Environment. This screen features a text editor, a command line interface (more
on this soon). These are the tools you will use to interface with your box.
Believe it or not, you can do most things with your box that you can do with
your own computer. We're going to use this box to create files, write programs
in these files, and run these programs and view their results.

Your box should come with a folder by default called `workspace`. We will be
primarily working inside this folder during this course.
