### Git Installation

Git is a distributed version control tool that allows developers to
manage versions of their code over time and facilitates collaboration
between several people who might be working on the same project.

Distributed means that each copy of any repostitory contains the entire
history of the project.

To install git, download the latest release from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/download).

Double click on the downloaded file, and run through the installer.

You know it worked if the output of 

    $ git --version

is greater than or equal to `2.0.0`
