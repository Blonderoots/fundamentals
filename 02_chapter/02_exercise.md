### Git Installation

Git is a distributed version control tool that allows developers to manage versions of their code over time and facilitates collaboration between several people who might be working on the same project.

Distributed means that each copy of any repostitory contains the entire history of the project.

To install git, download the latest release from [git-scm.com](http://git-scm.com/download).

Double click on the downloaded file, and run through the installer.

You will know it worked if, when you open up the terminal and type:

```
$ git --version
```

to check to see what version of git is running, your computer returns something greater than or equal to `2.0.0`:
