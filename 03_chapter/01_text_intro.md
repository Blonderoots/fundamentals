#Why Javascript?

In WDI, we'll be using the programming language, JavaScript.

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and is one of the most widely used languages on the web. When images wiggle or popups annoy you, that’s all JavaScript.

One of the best reasons to start with Javascript compared to other languages is that you do not need to install or configure a complicated environment to get started with it.  

All you need is a browser. We recommend you use Google Chrome or Firefox (you can use the one you like most).

#Set up Your Environment

The example code files you'll need for the exercises in this Gitbook can be downloaded [here](/assets/rock_paper_scissors).

In this folder, you'll find an example of a Javascript application. Double click on the 'index.html' file, which should automatically open in your browser.  

While this is a relatively simple application –it only takes up one web page, there is a lot going on behind the scenes.

To understand how this application works and to build one of your very own, you'll need to read and write in code.
