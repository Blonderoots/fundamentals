##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9fn) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
typeof (/* Write your expression here */);
// Should equal 'string'

typeof (/* Write your expression here */);
// Should equal 'number'

typeof (/* Write your expression here */);
// Should equal 'boolean'
```

Everything written next to "/" above, is called a *comment* - it tells the computer to completely ignore everything between the two `/` characters. There are two kinds of comments: **multi-line** comments (`/* comment */`), which can run across multiple lines, and 'single-line' comments (`// comment`), which only comment out everything following it on the current line.

Your job, in this exercise, is to replace each of those comments with an expression that evaluates to either `string`, `number` or `boolean`, respectively. 

You can use any expression you like, but make sure your expression includes at least one operator. 

You can check your answers in the console by running the code (pressing the play button at the top of the editor).

>**HINT** To run an individual line of code without running the suceeding lines, try commenting out the lines you do not want to run using "//".
