##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9SQ) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
function someNumber() {
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function someString() {
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function someBoolean() {
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}
```

`/*Your Expression*/`, above, is called a *comment* - it tells the computer to completely ignore everything between the two `/` characters. There are two kinds of comments: 'span'/'multi-line' comments (`/* comment */`), which can run across multiple lines, and 'single-line' comments (`// comment`), which can't.

Your job, in this exercise, is to replace each of those comments with an expression - any expression you like - that evaluates to either `360`, `"Hello world"`, or `true`, respectively. You can check your answers in the console by entering the commands `someNumber()`, `someString()`, or `someBoolean()`.

If all three of those commands give you the correct answers, nice job - you're done! Save your repl.it session and copy the new URL for your session (along with your name and cohort) into the form below.
