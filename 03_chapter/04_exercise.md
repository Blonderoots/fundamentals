##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9g5) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
console.log(typeof (/* Write your expression here*/));
// Should equal 'string'

console.log(typeof (/* Write your expression here*/));
// Should equal 'number'

console.log(typeof (/* Write your expression here*/));
// Should equal 'boolean'
```

Everything written next to "/" above, is called a *comment* - it tells the computer to completely ignore everything between the two `/` characters. 

There are two kinds of comments: 

```javascript
// This is single-linea comment
/* This is a multiple line
comment */
```

Your job, in this exercise, is to replace each of those comments with an expression that evaluates to either `string`, `number` or `boolean`, respectively. 

You can use any expression you like, but make sure your expression includes at least one operator. 

You can check your answers in the console by running the code (pressing the play button at the top of the editor). We've written `console.log()`so that the console will print out the value of your expression.  Try running the code without `console.log()`.  The code will run, but you won't see that gratifying result of `string, number, boolean` on the screen.
