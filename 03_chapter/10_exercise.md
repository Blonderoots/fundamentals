##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

[Let's open up another repl.it session](http://repl.it/9lT). You should see the following code in the editor window:

```javascript
var x;
/* Your Expression */
```

This time, we're going to practice writing some expressions that utilize truthy and falsey. Just like last time, your expressions will incorporate a variable called `x`. These may seem a little tricky at first, but you should be able to solve all of them using the rules about truthy/falsey boolean expressions from the last lesson.

1. Write an expression that evaluates `x`, so long as `x` is not null; if `x` is null, the expression should evaluate to 100. `x` is equal to `null` when no value has been assigned to it (e.g. `var x;`), but you could also assign it the value of null (`var x = null;`). Test your expression for several different values of `x`, including `null` - does it behave like you expect?

2. Next, replace that expression with one that evaluates to `null` if `x` is `null`, but otherwise evaluates to 50 (irrespective of `x`'s value).

3. Finally, write an expression that evaluates to `true` if `x` is an empty string (`''`) but otherwise evaluates to `false`.

Were you able to get all of your expressions to work? If so, nice job!
