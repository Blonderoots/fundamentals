[Here is some more sample code](http://repl.it/9gO), again in a repl.it session. The contents are repeated below.

```javascript
console.log("What value do you want to give 'x'?");
var x = prompt("What value do you want to give 'x'?");
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to 100.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to whatever x's value is.
console.log(/*Your Expression*/);


console.log("What value do you want to give 'x'?");
var x = prompt("What value do you want to give 'x'?");
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to null.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to 50, irrespective of x's value.
console.log(/*Your Expression*/);


console.log("What value do you want to give 'some_string'?");
var some_string = prompt("What value do you want to give 'some_string'?");
    //If some_string is an empty string, your expression should evaluate to true.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to false.
console.log(/*Your Expression*/);
```
