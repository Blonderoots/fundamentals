##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

[Here is some more sample code](http://repl.it/9SR), again in a repl.it session. The contents are repeated below.

```javascript
function oneHundredIfNull(x) {
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to 100.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to whatever x's value is.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function fiftyUnlessNull(x) {
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to null.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to 50, irrespective of x's value.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function isEmptyString(some_string) {
  // If some_string is an empty string, your expression should evaluate to true.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to false.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}
```
As before, if everything works, save your session and submit the new URL (along with your name and cohort) into the form below.
