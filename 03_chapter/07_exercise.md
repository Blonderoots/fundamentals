##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

[This repl.it session has been pre-loaded with the sample code below.](http://repl.it/9S0)

```javascript
function addTen(x) {
  // If x is 10, your expression should evaluate to 20.
  // If x is 50, your expression should evaluate to 60.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function triplePlusFive(x) {
  // If x is 5, your expression should evaluate to 20.
  // If x is 20, your expression should evaluate to 65.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function sayHello(name) {
  // If name is "Alice", your expression should evaluate to "Hello, Alice."
  // If name is "Bob", your expression should evaluate to "Hello, Bob."
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function sayGoodbye(name) {
  // If name is "Charlene", your expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, Charlene."
  // If name is "David", your expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, David."
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}
```

As in the previous exercise, your job is to replace each of those `/*Your Expression*/` comments with an expression. This time, however, the expression will need to depend on a variable. Take a look at one of those lines that says `function`; unlike last time, there should be a variable listed in the parentheses to the right. This variable represents an `input` that our expression will be using. Write your expressions so that they behave like the descriptions given in the single-line comments.

Once you've finished, save `some_more_expressions.js`, copy the entire contents of the file into repl.it's editor, and click the `>` button. Like last time, we'll be entering some commands (`addTen()`, `triplePlusFive()`,`sayHello()`, `sayGoodbye()`) into the console; however, this time, we'll need to specify some input values in order to see if our expressions were correct. We do this by putting input values in between the parentheses. For example, `addTen(5)` will use `5` as an input value; `sayHello("Max")` will use `"Max"` as an input value.

Try testing out all of the different 'test cases' that the comments specify in the console. If they all give you the answers that you expect, you're done! Save your repl.it session and (as before) put your name, cohort, and the new URL of your saved repl.it session into the form below.
