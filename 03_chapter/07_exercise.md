##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9gI) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Please Enter a Numer");
//this console.log is here because this repl.it console does not display the prompt message, though any other environment would
var x = prompt("Please Enter a Number");
  // If x is 10, your expression should evaluate to 20.
  // If x is 50, your expression should evaluate to 60.
console.log(/* Your Expression */);

console.log("Please Enter a Numer");
var y = prompt("Please Enter a Number");
  // If y is 5, your expression should evaluate to 20.
  // If y is 20, your expression should evaluate to 65.
console.log(/* Your Expression */);

console.log("What is your name?");
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
  // If name is "Alice", your expression should evaluate to "Hello, Alice."
  // If name is "Bob", your expression should evaluate to "Hello, Bob."
console.log(/* Your Expression */);

console.log("What is your name?");
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
  // If name is "Charlene", your expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, Charlene."
  // If name is "David", your expression should evaluate to "Goodbye, David."
console.log(/* Your Expression */);
```

As in the previous exercise, your job is to replace each of those `/*Your Expression*/` comments with an expression. 

This time, however, the expression will need to depend on a variable.Write your expressions so that they behave like the descriptions given in the single-line comments.

To test if our expressions work correctly, we will need to specify some input values in the console.  

When you run your code, you should see the prompt message (visible because of the console.log line we added before we define the variable).

Write your input and hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.

Try testing out all of the different 'test cases' that the comments specify in the console. If they all give you the answers that you expect, you're done!
