## Say Hello

If you haven't already, now's a great time for you to say hello to your global classmates. Jump into the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) Slack channel and introduce yourself!

Here are some questions to get you started:

- Who was your favorite teacher, and why?
- What is your guilty pleasure?
- Are you moving from another city in order to take WDI?
- What's the coolest thing you've ever built or made?
