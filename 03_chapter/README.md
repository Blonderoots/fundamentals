# JavaScript

Now that you've learned (1) how to create and edit files via the command line, (2) how to track changes in your projects using git, and (3) how to share those projects with the world by putting them up on GitHub, it's time for us to move on to the main event: programming.

Programming is just as much about solving problems as it is writing code.  Problems such as:

  > "How many students are here today?"

  > "How far away am I from the restaurant?"

  > "What's the fastest way to find the file I'm looking for?"

Trying to 'just start coding', without first figuring out the problem is a surefire way to run into trouble. However, in order to understand how to solve a problem, you first need to understand the tools at your disposal.

In this chapter, we'll be exploring the most common tools in a programmer's arsenal. Although we will be looking at a specific language called **JavaScript**, nearly every modern programming language behaves in ~~the same~~ a similar way.

## Repl.it
To start playing around with JavaScript, we'll be using a web platform called **[Repl.it](ht
tp://repl.it/languages/JavaScript)**.

As you can see in the screenshot above, repl.it features two main windows. On the right, with the black background, is the *console* - this tool (much like the Terminal on your computer) will accept a single instruction from the user and attempt to run it when the user hits "enter". On the left, with the white background, is the *editor*. The editor (much like a text editor on your computer) allows us to write several instructions in sequence; to execute these instructions in the console, click the 'play' button near the top.

To save your repl.it session, just click the 'save' icon in the upper right - it'll generate a URL that you can bookmark and come back to any time you want.

## Git and GitHub

We'll also be using Git and GitHub for the exercises in this unit, so go back to unit 2 if you need a refresher.

We've prepared a mostly-blank repository for you on GitHub called [`fundamentals-exercises`](); fork it on GitHub, and clone it down to somewhere on your computer using the command:

```git 

clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/fundamentals-exercises.git

```

All the code for your exercises will go in this directory; as you finish this assignment, you'll push your code back up to GitHub and (once you've completely finished) you'll initiate a ***pull request*** to submit your code for review.
