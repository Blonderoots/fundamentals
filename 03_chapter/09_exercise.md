Go back to the `wdi-fundamentals-exercises` repo and open up the file `even_more_expressions.js`. It should contain the following code.

```javascript

function oneHundredIfNull(x) {
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to 100.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to whatever x's value is.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function fiftyUnlessNull(x) {
  // If x is null, your expression should evaluate to null.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to 50, irrespective of x's value.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

function isEmptyString(some_string) {
  // If some_string is an empty string, your expression should evaluate to true.
  // Otherwise, your expression should evaluate to false.
  return /*Your Expression*/;
}

```
As before, save your code and test it in repl.it - if everything works the way you expect, go back to the `wdi-fundamentals-exercises` repo and make a commit, with the commit message "Completes even_more_expressions.js".
