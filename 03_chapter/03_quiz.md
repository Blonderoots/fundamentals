Try drawing expression trees for the following expressions, and evaluating them by hand using the approach described earlier (left-child first, then right-child). To submit your answer, replace the expressions below with your evaluation and hit submit.

Did you get the expected result?

```js
9 - 1 + 2 - 4;
(30 - 5)*2/5;
("The " + "rain ") + ("in Spain " + "stays ") + "mainly " + ("in " + "the ") + "plain.";
(true || false) && (true && false);
```

```js
6;
10;
"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.";
false;
```

```js
assert(6);
assert(10);
assert("The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain.");
assert(false);
```
