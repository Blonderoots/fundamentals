Write a Ruby program called `the_journey.rb`. In this program:

* Print out a statement asking the user to choose a direction: `up or down`
* Use the `gets()` method to get the user's input and store it in a variable
* Based on the user's input print out one of the following statements and store the location in a variable:
	* We're headed up the mountain!
	* We're headed down into the cave!
* Print out a statement asking the user to choose a number between 1 and 100
* Based on the user's input print out one of the following statements where USER_LOCATION is the stored location and NUMBER is the user's second input:
	* input equal to 100 -> `You've achieved enlightment in the [USER_LOCATION] ! Spread joy around the world!`
	* input greater than or equal to 50 but less than 100 -> `There are [NUMBER] goblins in the [USER_LOCATION]. WE MUST FIGHT!`
	* input greater than 20 but less than 50 -> `It's been a long passage! There is still hope that we will make it to the [USER_LOCATION] before the [NUMBER] Snufflebums get us!`
	* input less than or equal to 20 -> `We have conquered the Goon Squad of the [USER_LOCATION]. It only took us [NUMBER] years!!!`

Write a Ruby program called `my_calculator.rb`. In this program:

* Print out a statement that asks the user to input a number
* Use the `gets()` method to get the user's input and store it in a variable `first_number`
* Print out another statement that asks the user to input one of the four basic math operators `+ | - | * | /` or the word describing each `add | subtract | multiply | divide`
* Again, use the `gets()` method to accept and store this input in a variable
* Print out another statement asking the user to input a final number, and store this input in a variable
* Print out the two numbers that the user has input

Write a conditional statement that will determine the final output of your program. If the value stored in the operator variable:

* matches addition, then perform that action and print out the result
* matches subtraction, then perform that action and print out the result
* matches multiplication, then perform that action and print out the result
* matches division, then perform that action and print out the result
* if the input doesn't match any of the four math operators print the statement `Your math is bad and you should feel bad`

Run your program and check to see if all of the conditions are working.

* Did you run into any problems? How did you fix them?
