**A Computer Program**



#### Exercise - Logical Operators

Write a Ruby program called `hot_or_cold.rb`. In this program:

* Print out a statement that asks the user for the current temperature
* Use the `gets()` method to accept and store the user's input in a variable called `current_temp`
* Print out a second statement that asks the user to input the temperature that they would like it to be
* Store this user input in a variable called `requested_temp`

Define a conditional statement that will perform the following actions based on the user's input:

* If the current temperature is less than the requested temperature print the statement: `Alright, turn on the heat!`
* If the current temperature is the same as the requested temperature print the statement: `OK, I'll leave things as they are.`
* If the current temperature is greater than the requested temperature print the statement: `Turn on the AC! Stat!!`
* If the requested temperature is not above `0` print the statement: `Our system cannot handle that`
