##Plug into the WDI Community

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. As you take on a career as a web developer, you'll be surrounded by teammates, friends, and community members who will be able to help you with your questions and guide you to solutions.

Right now, you're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. In the meantime, we invite you to connect with your instructor and classmates via Slack, which is our preferred messaging tool. **To sign on to Slack, first check your email for an invitation from your producer.**

Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter "ga-students" where the page asks for your team domain, and join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!
