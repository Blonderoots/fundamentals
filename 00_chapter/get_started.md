**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

##Plug into the WDI Community

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors, developers-in-residence, and TAs you work with will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just giving you the right answer.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your instructor and classmates via Slack, a real time messaging application. To sign on to Slack, first check your email for an invitation from your producer.

Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter "ga-students" where the page asks for your team domain, and join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!

##Get Help from a GA Mentor

In addition to help you'll find online and from your classmates on Slack, we're giving you around-the-clock access to WDI graduates. We'll email you about this service again one week before class starts, but if you would like to connect with your mentor before then, go ahead and sign up [here](URL).
