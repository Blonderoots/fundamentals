##Get Help from GA Mentors

Once you step on campus, you're going to have lots of help from instructors and classmates in your cohort. Through study sessions, group projects, and more, you'll have nearly limitless opportunities to collaborate and ask for help when you get stuck.

WDI is a full-time program, and there will be days and weeks where most of the class stays late to work on projects or assignments. Even so, we want WDI to be a balanced and flexible environment for our students, and we want you to be able to balance your schedule in a way that helps you best succeed in this course.

Thanks to our new GA Mentors program, we're giving you access to online support from WDI graduates around the world who will be able to help you at any time of day or night. You'll get an email one week before your course begins, at which time you can login and connect with a mentor. In fact, your last assignment in this book is to review your work with one of our online mentors before you show up to class.
