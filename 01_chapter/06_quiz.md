What is Ada's working directory at the end of this terminal session?:
- [ ] /Users/adalovelace/
- [ ] Home Directory
- [x] desktop
- [ ] /Users/adalovelace/desktop/notes

> Not quite.
> The working directory is <code>desktop</code>, as you can see in the prompt and the frame of the terminal window.  The full path for <code>desktop</code> is <code>/Users/adalovelace/desktop/</code> but you can refer to the working directory by its name alone. 

What was Ada's working directory at the beginning of this terminal session?:
- [x] /Users/adalovelace/
- [ ] Adas-Macbook-Air
- [ ] desktop
- [ ] /Users/adalovelace/desktop/notes

> Not quite.
> The working directory was Ada's home directory, the full path for which is <code>/Users/adalovelace/</code>. It is represented by the <code>~</code> tilde symbol in the first line of this terminal session, before Ada changes her working directory to <code>desktop</code>.

What does the desktop of Ada's computer contain?:
- [ ] /Users/adalovelace/
- [ ] ls
- [x] Analytical_Engine.txt, scientific_memoirs.pdf, and a directory called 'notes'
- [ ] Nothing, it's empty

> Not quite.
> As you can after Ada lists the contents of <code>desktop</code> (her current working directory), the computer returns the names of two files and a folder.
