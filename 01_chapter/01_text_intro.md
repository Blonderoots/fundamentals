##Chapter 1: A Computer Program

We use computers to perform tasks that would be time consuming for us to perform
manually. A great example of such a task is calculating your taxes. Computers
can crunch numbers extremely fast. The very computer you are on right now can
perform around two billion arithmetic operations every second! The average human
being can probably do one or two every second.

Another reason that we get computers to do our dirty work is that they are very
accurate in their operations. If you ask a computer to do a million math
problems, chances that it will make a mistake are virtually zero. A human, on
other hand, would be prone to (rightfully-named) human error.

Hold on. If that's the case, if computers are super fast and super accurate, why
don't we use them to accomplish every single thing in the world? Why do there
still exist jobs that have not been automated with computers?

Though they are fast and accurate, computers need to be told how to do their job
with very explicit instructions. We call a set of these instructions a program.

If you wanted your friend to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you might
say to them "Can you make me a PB&J?". If you wanted a computer to make you a
PB&J, your instructions would have to be much more detailed.

```
Locate the bread
Locate the peanut butter
Locate the jelly
Locate a plate
Locate a knife
Open the bread's plastic cover
Take out two slices of bread
Place those two slices of bread on the plate side by side
Twist off lid of peanut butter
Place lid on counter
Pick up knife
Scoop one tablespoon of peanut butter
Deposit peanut butter on the first slice of bread on plate
And so on...
```

This is a taste of the level of explicitness required to write a program.
A computer can only understand very basic instructions (like 'locate the bread',
or 'add two numbers together'). It is up to us as developers to be able to
assemble a set of these simple instructions into a complicated action.

> A set of very low-level steps to be executed exactly and in the specified
> order, as in the PB&J example, is called an *algorithm*. An implementation of
> an algorithm to be executed by a computer is called a *program*.


#Why Javascript?

In WDI, we'll be writing code using the programming language, JavaScript.

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and is one of the most widely used languages on the web. When images wiggle or popups annoy you, that’s all JavaScript.

One of the best reasons to start with Javascript compared to other languages is that you do not need to install or configure a complicated environment to get started with it.  

All you need is a browser. We recommend you use Google Chrome or Firefox (you can use the one you like most).

#Set up Your Environment

The example code files you'll need for the exercises in this Gitbook can be downloaded [here](/assets/rock_paper_scissors).

In this folder, you'll find an example of a Javascript application. Double click on the 'index.html' file, which should automatically open in your browser.  

While this is a relatively simple application –it only takes up one web page, there is a lot going on behind the scenes.

To understand how this application works and to build one of your very own, you'll need to read and write in code.
