Before we tell the computer what to do, it's important we understand what it is we will be manipulating.

You're probably used to seeing files and folders as icons in a list or in columns.

Your computer organizes and stores files using a file system.

In programming-speak, all folders are called directories.

A directory within another directory is called a subdirectory.

A directory that contains a subdirectory or file is called a parent directory.

The topmost directory of any file is called the root directory –nothing contains it.

For the purposes of this lesson, the root directory of everything on your computer is your home directory. It's aptly represented in the GUI by a house icon.

We know how file and directories appear in the GUI –now let's find our way around this system in command line.

Computers are dumb. To ask for a specific directory or file in command line, we need to write out a precise address, called a path so that the computer knows exactly where to find it.

For example, if you Google directions to "Main Street," without any additional information, Google wouldn't know which of the 10,466-plus Main Streets you want.

You have to be more specific with your computer.

Your computer understands two kinds of addresses or paths, absolute and relative.

An absolute path starts from the root. It's analogous to saying the full address you want starting from Planet Earth as your reference point.

 If you're standing on a street corner in Anchorage, Alaska you wouldn't need the full address to find Main Street. You could just jump in a taxi and say "Main Street, please.
"

In this case, you'd be using a relative path.

>**NOTE**It's important to know where you're working from so that you know whether to communicate with your computer using absolute or relative paths.
