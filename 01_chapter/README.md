#Why Javascript?

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world and is one of the most widely used languages on the web.

It is both a frontend and a backend language.

One of the best reasons to start with Javascript compared to other languages is that you do not need to install or configure a complicated environment to get started with it.  

All you need is a browser. We recommend you use Google Chrome or Firefox (you can use the one you like most).

The example code files you'll need for the exercises in this Gitbook can be downloaded [here]().
