Adrian decided to do some "spring cleaning" during this session in command line.

What does Adrian's home directory contain? ![:image](../assets/chapter1/quiz3.gif)

- [ ] four directories (Documents, Pictures, Desktop, Applications)
- [x] two directories (college and images_backup)
- [ ] one directory ("thesis") and three files (graduation-picture.jpg, grocery-list-2005.txt, untitled-essay1.doc)
- [ ] None of the above

> Not quite.

> Adrian lists the contents of his home directory on the third line (remember, the ~ symbol is shorthand for the home directory), and the computer returns two folders (college and images_backup).
