**WDI Fundamentals Unit 1**

Adrian decided to do some "spring cleaning" during this session in command line.

What does Adrian's home directory contain? ![:image](../assets/chapter1/quiz3.gif)

- [ ] four directories (Documents, Pictures, Desktop, Applications)
- [x] two directories (college and images_backup)
- [ ] one directory ("thesis") and three files (graduation-picture.jpg, grocery-list-2005.txt, untitled-essay1.doc)
- [ ] None of the above

> Not quite.
>
> Adrian lists the contents of his home directory on the third line (remember, the ~ symbol is shorthand for the home directory), and the computer returns two folders (college and images_backup).

What changes did Adrian make to the "/college" directory?*

- [ ] moved the images_backup directory into the college directory
- [ ] deleted a directory and moved a file out of the college directory
- [ ] moved two files out of the college directory
- [x] deleted a file and moved a file out of the college directory

> Not quite.
>
> Adrian deleted grocery-list-2005.txt and moved graduation-picture.jpg into the images-backup directory.

What command would Adrian use to rename 'untitled_essay.doc' to 'draft1.doc'?*

- [ ] `cp draft1.doc untitled_essay.doc`
- [x] `mv draft1.doc untitled_essay.doc`
- [ ] `cp untitled_essay.doc draft1.doc`
- [ ] `mv untitled_essay.doc draft1.doc`

> Not quite.
>
> Adrian would need to use the mv command using the new file name as the second argument.
