We've gone ahead and created a new directory for you, called <em>World</em>. Download it <a href="http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/assets/activity/World.zip">here

When you double-click on the zip file, it will create a new folder next to the zip file in your Downloads folder.

Now that you can picture where the file is located, open the Terminal application

Using the command line alone,
1. Move the World directory from Downloads to your home directory
2. Check to see if you successfully moved the World directory by listing the contents of your home directory.
