**WDI Fundamentals Unit 4**

Read the following code and then answer the questions below.

```js
var age = 32;
if (age < 21) {
    console.log('Come back when you are older!');
} else if (age < 50) {
    console.log('Thank you. Come on in.')
} else {
    console.log('No need to card you, right this way!');
}
```

---
What will console.log print out if `age` is 32?

- [ ] Come back when you are older!
- [x] Thank you. Come on in.
- [ ] No need to card you, right this way!

> Not quite.
> If age equals 32, then age is greater than 21 and less than 50, yielding the message, "Thank you. Come on in!"

Read the following code and then answer the questions below.

```js
var isHungry = false;
var hasFoodInFridge = true;
if ( /* Your Expression */) {
    console.log('I need to buy food now!');
}
```
---

Let's assume that you need to buy food if <br>a) you're hungry AND <br>b) there is no food in the fridge.
Which of the conditions below should you use in the if statement
(replacing `"/ * Your Expression */"`) to print the message 'I need to buy food now!'?
- [ ] `isHungry && !hasFoodInFridge`
- [x] `!isHungry && hasFoodInFridge`
- [ ] `isHungry || !hasFoodInFridge`
- [ ] `isHungry && hasFoodInFridge`

> Not quite.
> In order for the condition to evaluate to truthy, it would need to be written so that both are true. "!isHungry || hasFoodInFridge"

Read the following code and then answer the questions below.

```js
var flower = prompt('What type of flower do you like?');
switch (flower) {
    case 'rose':
        console.log(flower + ' costs $2.50');
        break;
    case 'daisy':
        console.log(flower + ' costs $1.25');
        break;
    case 'orchid':
        console.log(flower + ' costs $1.50');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('There is no such flower in our shop');
        break;
}
```

---

What would the above code print out if the user's input was "orchid"?

- [ ] flower costs $1.50
- [ ] flower costs $2.50
- [ ] orchid costs $2.50
- [x] orchid costs $1.50

> Not quite.
> The switch statement would execute the first case that matches the 'flower' variable. We know the user inputted "orchid", so var flower = "orchid".
> The code that would be executed for the matching "orchid" case is "`flower` + " costs $1.50", which evaluates to "orchid costs $1.50".

What would the above code print out if the user's input was "tulip"?
- [ ] flower costs $2.50
- [ ] tulip costs $2.50
- [ ] tulip costs $1.25
- [x] There is no such flower in our shop

> Not quite.
> The user's input "tulip" does not match any of the cases in this code â€“ so the switch statement would evaluate the default case, printing "There is no such flower in our shop".
