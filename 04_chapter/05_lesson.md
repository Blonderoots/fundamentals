**A Computer Program**

#### Exercise - Fundamentals

Write a Ruby program called `strings_and_numbers.rb`. In this program:

Use `puts()` to output the result of the following statements:

* `5 / 3 + 1 / 3`
* `10 / 5 + 2`
* `7 - 3 / 3`

After each of the statements use `puts()` to print out your prediction for the result.

Now use `puts()` to print the result of the following statements and your prediction for the result after each statement:

* `3 * "swag"`
* `"I am a 1" + "337 h4xor"`
* `3 + "loco"`

Run the program in terminal and look at the output.

* Were your predictions correct? What do you notice about the way that Ruby performs math?
* Can you figure out how you can get the remainder of performing division?
* Did you get any errors? What did they say? Can you figure out a way to fix them?
