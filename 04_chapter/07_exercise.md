## Your Turn

Here's the [starter code](http://repl.it/aE0) for your next exercise:

```javascript

var max;

  /* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */


  // Your code should leverage your solution to the prior exercise.
  // In case you got stuck with that one, here's one possible solution you might have used.
  /*
  var x; // The value being tested.
  var result;
  if (x%3 === 0 && x%5 === 0) {
   result = 'fizzbuzz';
   } else if (x%3 === 0) {
   result = 'fizz';
   } else if (x%5 === 0) {
    result = 'buzz';
   } else {
    result = x;
  }  
*/

```

Last time, we wrote code that took an input `x` and set a new `result` value according to a specific set of rules.

This time, your challenge is to loop through every number from 1 to `max`, applying the same rules to each number and, finally, printing the result to the console using the command `console.log(result);`.

For example, if you ran the finished code with `max` equal to 10, the following should be displayed in the console:

```javascript
  1
  2
  fizz
  4
  buzz
  fizz
  7
  8
  fizz
  buzz
```
