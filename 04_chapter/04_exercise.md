##Your Turn

Follow [this link](http://repl.it/9Qy) to some sample code in a repl.it session - it should contain the following code:

```javascript
  function fizzOrBuzz(x) {
    // YOUR CODE HERE
  }
```

This exercise may be familiar to some of you. What we want this code to do is to give us back one of several values, depending on the value of `x`:
* If `x` is evenly divisible by 3 (for example, 3, 6, or 9), return "fizz".
* If `x` is evenly divisible by 5 (for example, 5 or 10), return "buzz".
* If `x` is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example, 0 or 15), return "fizzbuzz".
* If `x` is not evenly divisible by either 3 or 5 (for example, 7), return `x`.

> Don't remember how to determine if something divides evenly? Look back at Chapter 3 (Expressions) and take a look at the modulus (`%`) operator.

To test your code, try running `fizzOrBuzz()` in the console, using multiple different values for `x`. Once you're confident that your code works, save your repl.it session and enter that new URL (along with your name) into the form below.
