**WDI Fundamentals**

# Assessment
![Assessment](../images/icon_assessment.png "Assessment")


*You'd better test yourself, before you rest yourself.*

There are four parts to this assessment, each of them involving you writing a small Ruby program based on the concepts you've learned in this pre-course.

In order to submit your answers to this assessment, you'll upload a `.rb` file for each of the following four sections. Clicking on the SUBMIT link in the left menu will take you to a form where you can submit your work.

Please note that this is not a test, but we will pass these results on to your instructors so they can best prepare for the course. After submitting, feel free to check-in with a virtual mentor to review your work and identify which areas you can keep practicing as you get ready for Day 1 of WDI.

Happy coding!
