**WDI Fundamentals README for Instructors**

To set our new WDI students up for success, we've created a pilot Gitbook, [WDI Fundamentals](fundamentals.generalassemb.ly) for students to complete before Day 1 of class.

To maximize the impact of this content, PLEASE:

**1) Go through WDI Fundamentals yourself.**
This is an evolving product and we appreciate any and all feedback on its contents.

Please email Dana Reilly <dana@ga.co> or JD Maresco <jdm@ga.co> with your comments/questions/recommendations!

**2) Track student progress.**
You can view which students have completed the quiz at the end of each chapter (a good proxy for progress through the book) [here](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/spreadsheets/d/1P3ky0DRdo96aOWwbH2ZvlLVl6r8PM8TTMStKAPQ3Bmk/edit?usp=sharing).

This student-tracker spreadsheet also contains the students' score on each quiz.

**3) Grade Student projects.**
Ok, this sounds more time-intensive than it is.  All students are required to submit a final cumulative project â€“a RockPaperScissors.js file, containing a functioning javascript app.

Please review student projects (submitted via pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-fundamentals-rps).

Let us know in the student-tracker spreadsheet whether your students' JavaScript app:


|Grade | Description|
| -------------------|
|Exceedes Expectations | 
|Meets Expectations| 
|Does Not Meet Expectations | |
