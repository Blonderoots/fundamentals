## Check-in

Now's a good time for you to do your first check-in with one of our mentors. Most of our mentors are WDI grads who were in your shoes not too long ago. You can share your code, ask them for another explanation of any difficult concepts, or just chat with them about their experience in the course!

If you've already received your login credentials from your producer, <a href="https://ga.hackhands.com">head on over</a> to the GA Mentors site to get started.
