**Reference: Code Snippet 1**

```ruby
puts("How many pushups do you want me to do?")
pushups = gets().chomp().to_i()

if pushups < 10
  puts("Piece of cake, no problem.")
elsif pushups < 20
  puts("I think I broke a sweat.")
elsif pushups < 30
  puts("This is not as easy as I thought, but I can do that.")
else
  puts("Nice try. I'm going to go play video games.")
end
```

There is only one right answer.

`12 > 3`
  - [x] true
  - [ ] false

> Try again!

`9 < 5`
  - [ ] true
  - [x] false

> Try again!

`3 == 4`
  - [ ] true
  - [x] false

> Try again!

`8 != 12`
  - [x] true
  - [ ] false

> Try again!

In the context of Code Snippet 1, what message will be displayed if the user enters `27`?
  - [ ] "Piece of cake, no problem."
  - [ ] "I think I broke a sweat."
  - [x] "This is not as easy as I thought, but I can do that."
  - [ ] "Nice try. I'm going to go play video games."

> Try again!
