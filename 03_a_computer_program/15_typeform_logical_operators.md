```ruby
hungry = false
food_in_fridge = true

if CONDITION
  puts("I need to buy food now!")
end
```

There is only one right answer.

If A is false and B is true, what is A && B?
  - [ ] true
  - [x] false
  - [ ] 0
  - [ ] undefined

If A is false and B is true, what is A || B?
  - [x] true
  - [ ] false
  - [ ] 0
  - [ ] undefined

Take a look at Code Snippet 1. Let's assume that you need to buy food if (a) you're hungry and
(b) there is no food in the fridge. Which of the below conditions should you use in the `if` statement (replacing the word "CONDITION" in the code snippet)?
  - [ ] hungry && food_in_fridge
  - [ ] hungry || food_in_fridge
  - [ ] !hungry || food_in_fridge
  - [x] hungry && !food_in_fridge

> Try again!
