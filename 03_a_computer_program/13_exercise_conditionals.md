**A Computer Program**

---

#### Exercise - Conditionals

Part 1. **Write a Ruby program called `the_journey.rb`.** In this program:

* Print out a statement asking the user to choose a direction: `up or down`
* Use the `gets()` method to get the user's input and store it in a variable
* Based on the user's input print out one of the following statements:
	* We're headed up the mountain!
	* We're headed down into the cave!
* Store the location ("mountain" or "cave") in another variable
* Print out a statement asking the user to choose a number between 1 and 100
* Based on the user's input print out one of the following statements, where USER_LOCATION is the stored location and NUMBER is the user's second input:
	* if the input is equal to 100, print `You've achieved enlightment in the [USER_LOCATION]! Spread joy around the world!`
	* if the input is greater than or equal to 50 but less than 100, print `There are [NUMBER] goblins in the [USER_LOCATION]. WE MUST FIGHT!`
	* if the input is greater than 20 but less than 50, print `It's been a long passage! There is still hope that we will make it to the [USER_LOCATION] before the [NUMBER] Snufflebums get us!`
	* if the input is less than or equal to 20, print `We have conquered the Goon Squad of the [USER_LOCATION]. It only took us [NUMBER] years!!!`

Part 2. **Write a Ruby program called `my_calculator.rb`.** In this program:

* Print out a statement that asks the user to input a number
* Use the `gets()` method to get the user's input and store it in a variable named `first_number`
* Print out another statement that asks the user to input one of the four basic math operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` or the word describing each `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`
* Again, use the `gets()` method to accept and store this input in a variable named `operator`
* Print out another statement asking the user to input a final number
* Store this input in a variable named `second_number`
* Print the two numbers that the user has inputted (e.g. "You've inputted 3 and 26!")
*Write a conditional statement that will determine the final output of your program. If the value stored in the operator variable:

	* matches addition, then perform that action and print out the result
	* matches subtraction, then perform that action and print out the result
	* matches multiplication, then perform that action and print out the result
	* matches division, then perform that action and print out the result
	* if the input doesn't match any of the four math operators print the statement `I don't understand that operator.`

**Run your programs and check to see if all of the conditions are working. Did you run into any problems? How did you fix them?**
