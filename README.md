# WDI Fundamentals


### Welcome

Welcome to the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. We're so glad you've decided to learn with us for the next several weeks.

### What this module covers

The virtual book you hold in your hands covers a few pre-course learning objectives that we'd like you to achieve as you prepare for this course. Our goal is to help you learn to:

1. **use the terminal to interact with your computer via the command line**
2. **write a basic computer program using a few of the basic building blocks of software development**
3. **organize data in various structures, including variables and collections**
4. **get a fly-by view of how web apps are constructed and a glimpse of what you're going to learn to build during WDI**

Whether this is all brand new to you, or if you've already been coding and using the command line for a while, we ask that you take the time to work through this material, since your instructors will reference it during the course.

### Getting help

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors, developers-in-residence, and TAs you work with will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just giving you the right answer. Since you're probably completing this mini-course at home or in a coffee shop, you don't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on Day 1 of your course.

That said, we wanted to make sure that even now you have someone to reach out to you when you get stuck. We've enlisted a number of former WDI graduates to make themselves available to help you as you work through this book via a virtual platform. In fact, we'd like to ask you to take advantage of these mentors' guidance at least twice as you work through the material (we'll remind you to do a check-in at various points).

Your login for this service should have been sent to you in a separate email. If you haven't received these credentials, please email your GA producer. Once signed up, you can [login on the GA Mentors site](https://ga.hackhands.com) and then click the button below to request help at any time.
