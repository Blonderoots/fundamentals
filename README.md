Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!

To set you up for success in the course, we've prepared a book covering the fundamentals of web-based programming. We'll return to these concepts throughout the course, but you'll be happy if Day 1 is not the first you're hearing of variables and loops (no, that is not a breakfast cereal).

The entire book is six chapters. We'll announce the release of new chapters in the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) Slack channel (see ['Get Started'](00_chapter/get_started.md) for more details on Slack).

##What We'll Cover

Once you've finished WDI Fundamentals, you will have a working Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in JavaScript – the most popular programming language of the web.

We'll also be using git.

While git isn’t a programming language, it’s often used with them – it’s a version control system. Version control is a way of keeping track of the history of your code, along with providing a structure that encourages collaboration and makes it easy to work on code with a team.

Github is a company that runs the most popular cloud-based service for storing what git calls a "repository." You'll also be accessing assignments and submitting your work to your instructors via Github, so it's a good idea to get familiar with it now.

[Ok, let's get started!](00_chapter/get_started.md)
