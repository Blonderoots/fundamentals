# WDI Fundamentals

Dear WDI Student,

We're really excited that you've decided to learn with us. We're providing this learning module so that you can get an early start on several core concepts in web-based programming. We'll be returning to these concepts and covering them in more depth during the course, but if you spend time on them now, you'll be able to give yourself a good head start (you'll be glad you did!).

The material will be released to you by module over the next few weeks. We'll announce in the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) Slack channel as new units are released (see below for more details on Slack).

### What this module covers

The virtual book you hold in your hands covers a few pre-course learning objectives that you'll need to focus on as you prepare for this course.

Our goal is to help you learn to:

1. **use the terminal to interact with your computer via the command line**
2. **write a basic computer program using a few of the basic building blocks of software development**
3. **organize data in various structures, including variables and collections**
4. **understand the basics of version control and Git**
5. **get a fly-by view of how web apps are constructed**

Whether this is all brand new to you, or if you've already been coding and using the command line for a while, we ask that you take the time to work through this material, since your instructors will reference it during the course.

### Getting help

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors, developers-in-residence, and TAs you work with will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just giving you the right answer.

You're probably completing this mini-course at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on Day 1 of your course. For now, we encourage you to log in to start chatting with students from around the world who are working through this prework with you. You can do this by downloading and logging into Slack, which will be the communication channel you'll be using to communicate with your classmates and instructors.

Once you've received a Slack invite from your producer, join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!

### Feedback

Please reach out to your course producer if you have any questions about anything related to your course. If you have any feedback about this learning module, please don't hesitate to reach out by emailing us at AskImmersives@generalassemb.ly.
