# WDI Fundamentals

Welcome to the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. We're so glad you've decided to learn with us for the next several weeks.

The virtual book you hold in your hands covers some pre-course learning objectives that we'd like to cover in order to help you better prepare for this course. It's a beta version of our new pre-work, and you're one of the first people to use it (get excited)!

In addition, the Fundamentals program is more than just a book – it's the first module of your learning with WDI. In addition to taking a few hours to work through these exercises, we're asking you to check-in with a GA Mentor at least once a week.

We are really interested to hear your suggestions and feedback, so don't hesitate to [reach out](jdm@generalassemb.ly).
