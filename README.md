Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive Program at General Assembly!

We hope you find WDI to be as rewarding as it is challenging â€” we can assure you it's challenging. There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn, and being unprepared can easily trip you up. To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming. These concepts will come up throughout the course, and becoming familiar with them before the course begins will help set you up for success.

The entire ebook is six units, however, the last two are currently being renovated (for your safety and ours). We'll let you know when those units are ready in the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) Slack channel (more on that once you click on).

[Ok, let's get started](00_chapter/get_started.md)
