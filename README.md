Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!

To set you up for success in the course, we've prepared a book covering the fundamentals of web-based programming. We'll return to these concepts throughout the course, but you'll be happy if Day 1 is not the first you're hearing of variables and loops (no, that is not a breakfast cereal).  

The entire book is [INSERT NUMBER HERE] chapters –which will be released one by one leading up to your first day. We'll announce new chapters in the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) Slack channel (see below for more details on Slack).

##What We'll Cover 

We'll also be using git.

While git isn’t a programming language, it’s certainly often used with them – it’s a version control system. Version control is a way of keeping track of the history of your code, along with providing a structure that encourages collaboration. Github is the most popular cloud-based service for keeping track of your code using git.


##Getting Help When You Need It

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace and excel in the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors, developers-in-residence, and TAs you work with will often help you drive your own process of discovery, rather than just giving you the right answer.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your instructor and classmates via Slack, a real time messaging application. To sign on to Slack, first check your email for an invitation from your producer.

Next, go to [slack.com](https://slack.com/signin), enter 'ga-students' where the page asks for your team domain, and join the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel to meet your global classmates!
