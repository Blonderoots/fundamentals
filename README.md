# Overview for Instructors and Producers
> Fundamentals is our global WDI prework, focused on programming fundamentals, source control, and command line interaction

The units in Fundamentals focus on:
- Command Line
- Git and Version Control
- Writing Expressions
- Control Flow
- Functions
- Collections

To help us maximize the impact of this experience for students, *please*:

### a) Go through WDI Fundamentals yourself
This is an evolving product and we appreciate any and all feedback on its contents.

Read more about our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### b) Monitor student progress

We track student progress by asking students to:
- complete one quiz at the end of each unit
- submit a link to their project at the end of the final unit

After being sent Fundamentals, a producer will add each student to the GA-Students Slack team. Once students sign up, producers can easily check in with them by sending them a Slack message each of the weeks leading up to the course, and students can ask for help from their fellow classmates. 

Producers and instructors can track student progress in [this dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hqVxp0VJd1TFZNg7V7C2Gi-ziVrc_QXDrYsnQRvYYK0/edit#gid=1573361045)

### c) Review student projects.
All students are required to submit a final cumulative project that is the culmination of each of the unit homework assignments. Their submission contains a RockPaperScissors.js file, with a functioning JavaScript app.

In the tracker above, you can find the submissions from students. The DIRs or Instructional Associates from each cohort should briefly review each of these submissions, leaving a comment.

> **We try to commit to commenting on each student's pull request with a few sentences, including at least one positive element of feedback and one opportunity for improvement.**
