# Overview for Instructors and Producers
> Fundamentals is our global WDI prework, focused on programming fundamentals, source control, and command line interaction

The units in this Gitbook include:
- Think Like a Programmer
- Git and Version Control
- Writing Expressions
- Control Flow
- Functions
- Collections

To help us maximize the impact of this experience for students, *please*:

### a) Go through WDI Fundamentals yourself
This is an evolving product and we appreciate any and all feedback on its contents.

Read more about our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### b) Monitor student progress
**Quiz submissions** have been migrated to use a Gitbook quiz plugin and are intended to allow students to self-assess. Results are not tracked.

After being sent Fundamentals, a producer will add each student to the GA-Students Slack team. Once students sign up, producers can easily check in with them by sending them a Slack message each of the weeks leading up to the course.

### c) Review student projects.
All students are required to submit a final cumulative project that is the culmination of each of the unit homework assignments. Their submission contains a RockPaperScissors.js file, with a functioning JavaScript app.

Student projects are submitted via pull request to [this repo](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-fundamentals-rps). Students are also instructed to send their submission to their instructor during orientation.

One instructor from the cohort should volunteer to briefly review each of these submissions, leaving a comment.

> **We try to commit to commenting on each student's pull request with a few sentences, including at least one positive element of feedback and one opportunity for improvement.**
