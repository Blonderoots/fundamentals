# WDI Fundamentals


### Welcome

Welcome to the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. We're so glad you've decided to learn with us for the next several weeks.

### What this module covers

The virtual book you hold in your hands covers a few pre-course learning objectives that we'd like you to achieve as you prepare for this course. Our goal is to help you learn to:

1. **use the terminal to interact with your computer via the command line**
2. **write a basic computer programs using a few of the basic building blocks of software development**
3. **organize data in various structures, including variables and collections**
4. **get a fly-by view of how web apps are constructed and a glimpse of what you're going to learn to build during WDI**

Whether this is all brand new to you, or if you've already been coding and using the command line for a while, we ask that you take the time to work through this material, since your instructors will reference it during the course.

### GA Mentors

In addition to taking a few hours to work through these exercises, we're asking you to check-in with a GA Mentor at least once a week.

You can [login on the GA Mentors site](https://ga.hackhands.com) with the credentials that have been sent to you in a separate email. If you haven't received these credentials, please email your GA producer.

### Feedback

We are really interested to hear your suggestions and feedback, so don't hesitate to [reach out](jdm@generalassemb.ly).
