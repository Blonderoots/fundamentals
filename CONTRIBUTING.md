this should happen a week before:
Producer makes a list of studnets who have not done prework,
sends an email that says you have not done
emails instructors,

instructors will have a list of students who have done the prework so that they can follow up with the students at installfest

students want feedback on their prework so that they know that someone is looking at their work so that they feel accountable otherwise they won't do the prework.

regional directors will dictate what happens to students who don't complete prework by day one.
