* How would we access the second element in an array?
  * arr(1)
  * arr(2)
  * arr[1]
  * arr[2]
* How would you access the last element of an array without changing the array?
  * .push()
  * .pop()
  * .first()
  * .last()
* How would you add an element at the end of the array?
  * .push()
  * .pop()
  * .first()
  * .last()

```ruby
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
fruits.pop()
fruits.push("grape")
fruits.push("banana")
```

* After the code above has executed, what is `fruits`?
  * ["apple", "orange", "grape", "banana"]
  * ["banana", "grape", "apple", "orange"]
  * ["orange", "grape", "banana", "grape", "banana"]
  * ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]
