#### Quiz - Arrays

---

Let's recap our knowledge of arrays.

How would we access the second element in an array?:
  - [ ] arr(1)
  - [ ] arr(2)
  - [x] arr[1]
  - [ ] arr[2]

> Remember, computers count array elements starting from 0.

How would you access the last element of an array without changing the array?:
  - [ ] .push()
  - [ ] .pop()
  - [ ] .first()
  - [x] .last()

> `push()` and `pop()` will modify your array!

How would you add an element at the end of the array?:
  - [x] .push()
  - [ ] .pop()
  - [ ] .first()
  - [ ] .last()

After the code above has executed, what is `fruits`?:
  - [x] `["apple", "orange", "grape", "banana"]`
  - [ ] `["banana", "grape", "apple", "orange"]`
  - [ ] `["orange", "grape", "banana", "grape", "banana"]`
  - [ ] `["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]`
