#### Exercise - Iteration

Write a program called `unit_converter.rb`.

In this program

* Create an array of numbers called `meters`
* Create an array of numbers called `fahrenheits`
* Iterate through `meters` to print a list of lengths in centimeters, by
  multiplying each element in `meters` by 100.
* Iterate through `fahrenheits` to print a list of temperatures in Celsius, by
  converting each element in the array to [Celsius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#Definition_and_conversions).
