## Outline

The world of programming is beautiful. We can make our computers achieve
phenomenal things by typing a sequence of letters into a file. Programming is a
craft, and to master this craft, we must first master our tools. Yes, before we
write any code, we are going to learn how to efficiently use our computers.

#### The Command Line

Regular users interact with computers through a variety of mechanisms. They
click on buttons, scroll through pages, drag and drop, type text, etc. Most of
these operations are interacting with the computer through its Graphical User
Interface, or GUI. It is easy and intuitive if you've been using a computer for any length of time.

However, you are on a journey to transcend being an ordinary user of computers.
You are on your way to becoming a developer, and developers like to interact
with computers in a different way. They like to master the tools at their
fingertips. They like to use the command line.

The command line is another interface to interact with your computer that looks
something like this.

That's right. No more buttons, no more pictures, no more menus. Only text. We
can perform actions using the command line by **entering commands**. There
is a command to perform virtually any action you can imagine on your computer!
There are commands to open an application, create new files, copy files from
one place to another, and a lot more.

_Aside: What if you imagine an action that there isn't a command for? In this
case, you can create your own "commands" or scripts that will achieve what you
want. This is called 'shell scripting'._

> Developers sacrifice the ease and intuitive nature of a GUI for greater power, efficiency, and flexibility of the actions they can perform in a command line interface.

The most common **Command Line Interface** (CLI) found on MacOS and Linux
machines is "Terminal".

**For the following section, you are going to work on your local machine, and not
on your Nitrous box.**

***Note: This version of WDI Fundamentals only supports MacOS beyond this point***

Go ahead an open up "Terminal" in any of the following ways.

* Navigate to your Applications folder and double-click on Terminal
* *Faster:* Press Command+Space on your keyboard to bring up a friend of ours, Spotlight.
  Spotlight is a tool that allows us to quickly find files and applications on
  our computer, but more on that later. Inside this search bar, type "Terminal",
  and select the Terminal application.

When you've opened up Terminal, and see a window similar to figure 1.1, proceed!
