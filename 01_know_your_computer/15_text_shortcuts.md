#### Keyboard Shortcuts

As a developer, you want to keep your hands on your keyboard as much as
possible. Hence, it becomes important to learn keyboard shortcuts to perform
common tasks, such as open and closing applications, opening and saving files,
and switching between active applications. This reduces the movement of your
hands between your keyboard and mouse, increasing your efficiency as a
developer. Remember, we're here to master our tools so we can master our craft.

Here are a list of common keyboard shortcuts that apply to most applications.

| Shortcut     | Function |
