#### Reference - Hashes

* A hash is an unordered collection of objects where each object (value) is uniquely
  identified by a label (key). In this sense, a hash is a set of key-value pairs.
* Values inside a hash can be accessed by key using square brackets
* Key-value pairs can be added to a hash using `hash[new_key] = new_value`
* A value can be modified using `hash[existing_key] = new_value`
* A key-value pair can be removed from a hash using `hash.delete(key)`
