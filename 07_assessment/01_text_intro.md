**WDI Fundamentals**

# Assessment
![Assessment](../images/icon_assessment.png "Assessment")


*You'd better test yourself, before you rest yourself.*

There are four parts to this assessment, each of them involving you writing a small Ruby program based on the concepts you've learned in this pre-course.

In order to submit your answers to this assessment, you'll upload a `.rb` file for each of the following four sections. Clicking on the SUBMIT link in the left menu will take you to a form where you can submit your work.

Please note that this is not a test, but we will pass these results on to your instructors so they can best prepare for the course. When you're done, feel free to keep chatting with your classmates in either the [#wdi-fundamentals](https://ga-students.slack.com/messages/wdi-fundamentals/) channel or other local channels (there's one for each city).

Happy coding!
